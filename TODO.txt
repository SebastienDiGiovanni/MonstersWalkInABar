In order of priority:
- Generate orders randomly for clients + Add order popups over client's heads
- Increase the size of colliders for the clients to make it possible to drop the glass at the bar
- Drop the glass at the bar and trigger the cocktail evaluation
- Add client reactions on good or bad cocktails
- Fix dropping into the trashcan (probably because of the collider size)
- Fix sprite render layers for the glass after it is picked up
- Add the popup over the player's head that will hold the thing being carried
